 <p><font color="" face="tahoma" size="4">Many technicians in the computer industry charge a flat rate (or several hours of time) to perform a "tune up" on your PC and will
 tell you that they've repaired it. This is seldom the best way to approach your problem and will not prevent the problem from coming again. The reality is that spyware removal,
 disk drive defragmentation, virus removal and definition updates, etc. are only temporary solutions if not coupled with completely securing your computer.
